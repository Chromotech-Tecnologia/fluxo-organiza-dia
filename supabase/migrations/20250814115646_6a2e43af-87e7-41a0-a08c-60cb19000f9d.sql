-- Corrigir dados inconsistentes de repasse de tarefas

-- 1. Atualizar scheduled_date das tarefas originais para corresponder ao originalDate no forward_history
UPDATE tasks 
SET scheduled_date = (forward_history->0->>'originalDate')::date,
    forward_count = jsonb_array_length(forward_history),
    updated_at = now()
WHERE forward_history IS NOT NULL 
  AND forward_history != '[]'::jsonb 
  AND scheduled_date != (forward_history->0->>'originalDate')::date;

-- 2. Atualizar forward_count para todas as tarefas com forward_history
UPDATE tasks 
SET forward_count = jsonb_array_length(forward_history),
    updated_at = now()
WHERE forward_history IS NOT NULL 
  AND forward_history != '[]'::jsonb 
  AND forward_count != jsonb_array_length(forward_history);

-- 3. Criar tarefas de destino que estÃ£o faltando
-- Para cada repasse no forward_history, verificar se existe uma tarefa na data de destino
